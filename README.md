#  VaCASHin

## Description
This project was built in accordance with instructions provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp's staff, with us writing code, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a unique application of our own design as a group project.
​
To that end, we created an online currency converter application that also returns relavent articles to the currency an indiidual chose to convert their money to, ostensibly for the purpose of making exchanging currency easy and friendly for the traveler to know how far there money will take them. The VaCASHin app is designed to take the worry out of how much they will need to spend so you can focus on the fun of vacation/travel.
​
Technically speaking, we created javascript functions which, by using data taken from user inputs as queries for fetch requests, are capable of appending data retrievied from online, free serverside apis to an html page. Said data consists of the aforementioned exchanged currency's information and pertinent news articles.

# Installation and Usage
No installation is required. One only needs to visit the deployed github pages page for this project in order to interact/use it properly. Said interaction/usage would involve choosing currencies one would like to convert from and to respectively as well as the amount one would like to exchange before pressing a button to initate that conversion. Doing so would return both the data from the exchange as well as news pertaining to the chosen conversion currency.
​
Alternatively, you can download the github repository and view the code to see how our group constructed the project.
​
Both methods will allow you to effectively "use" our code to the greatest degree possible.
